This framework for Unity XR development:
- Providing modules truly usable out-of-the box. Which are not ones (from well-known frameworks) with a bunch of responsibilities and thousands of codelines to be rewritten for each project.  
- Having flexible architecture simple to extend
- Maintaining at least sequence cohesion and data structure coupling for all modules.
- Offering modern comfortable UX leveraging advanced* selection system
